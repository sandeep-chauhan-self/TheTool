# Vercel Preview Deployment Environment Variables
# This ensures preview deployments (from any branch) use development backend
# 
# Set these in Vercel Dashboard → TheTool Project → Settings → Environment Variables
# Under "Preview" environment

# Force all preview deployments to use development backend
REACT_APP_API_BASE_URL=https://thetool-development.up.railway.app
REACT_APP_DEBUG=true

# For Production deployment (main/master branch only):
# REACT_APP_API_BASE_URL should NOT be set, allowing hostname detection
# Which will detect "the-tool-theta.vercel.app" and use production backend
